                    <p>If your relationship needs focused attention, you are experiencing strained communication, or even signs of distress, donâ€™t leave your relationship untended. I offer a two-day, 8- hour, weekend intensive for couples. This in- person experience includes instruction, support, and guidance through progressive series of conversations. Each conversation takes couples a step forward, to rebuild intimacy for a lifetime of love.</p>
					<p>During covid-19 quarantine, in person couple intensives are on temporary hold. Contact me by email susan@susanmorrow.us to get on the waiting list for future dates. I appreciate your patience.</p>
