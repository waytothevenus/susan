					<p>We live our lives in a digital age. While face to face, in-office, in person time is comforting and desirable, itâ€™s at times not practical.</p>
					<p>When you have life circumstances that make it difficult to attend in-office sessions, I am available to work with you through online or telephone services to optimize our therapy progress. Online therapy follows the same process you might expect at in-person meetings. If you have barriers that get in the way of in-person meetings-  childcare, travel, living in other regions, I provide these services to help you get the support you need.</p>
					<p>I am licensed in NC, and am available to NC residents for online individual, couples, and family therapy.</p>
					<p>If you live outside the NC area, I am available for individual and relationship coaching services.</p>
					<p>If you desire lasting love and strong bonds, contact me today to get started.</p>
