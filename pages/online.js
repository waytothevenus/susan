					<p>We live our lives in a digital age. While in person time is comforting and desirable, itâ€™s at times not practical.</p>
					<p>I am available to work with you through online or telephone services to optimize our therapy progress. Online therapy uses the same process you might expect at in-person meetings. If for some reason we are unable to meet in-person, I provide these services to help you get the support you need.</p>
					<p>I am licensed in NC, and am available to NC residents for online individual, couples, and family therapy.</p>
					<p>If you live outside the NC area, I am available for individual and relationship coaching services.</p>
					<p>If you desire lasting love and stronger bonds, contact me today to get started.</p>
